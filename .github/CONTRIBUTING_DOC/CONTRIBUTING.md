## Contributor Guidelines

## Issues

### Feature Requests

If you have ideas or how to improve our projects, you can suggest features by opening a GitHub issue. Make sure to include details about the feature or change, and describe any uses cases it would enable.

Feature requests will be tagged as `[enhancement]` and their status will be updated in the comments of the issue.

### Bugs

When reporting a bug or unexpected behaviour in a project, make sure your issue describes steps to reproduce the behaviour, including the platform you were using, what steps you took, and any error messages.

Reproducible bugs will be tagged as `[bug]` and their status will be updated in the comments of the issue.

### Wontfix

Issues will be closed and tagged as `[wontfix]` if we decide that we do not wish to implement it, usually due to being misaligned with the project vision or out of scope. We will comment on the issue with more detailed reasoning.
